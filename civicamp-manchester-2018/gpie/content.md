Over to Lawrence...

Note:
Eileen was involved early on.

It sucks when you are on an old version

It was fun to do the upgrade.

# How it works

## Membership types

[Green Party membership types](https://anon.my.greenparty.ie/civicrm/admin/member/membershipType?reset=1)

Map your membership structure into CiviCRM

- Fees
- Duration
- Auto-renew options
- Related members


-

## Membership statuses

[Green Party membership statuses](https://anon.my.greenparty.ie/civicrm/admin/member/membershipStatus?reset=1)

Describe the membership life-cycle

-

## Online sign up and renewal

[Join form](https://my.greenparty.ie/join)

- Recurring payments by default
- Completely automated, including:
  - user account creation
  - welcome emails

Note:

Intervention only required for exceptional cases. No work required for optimal route.

-

## Recurring payments

[Donate form](https://my.greenparty.ie/donate-one-off)

- Uses the Stripe extension (mantained by MJW)
- Membership payments are recurring by default
- Donations are one off or recurring
- We're improving the cancellation workflow

-

## Website Integration

- Website is WordPress but CiviCRM is on Drupal
- Public facing Civi pages are 'WordPress-Drupal lovechild'
- e.g. the [volunteer form](http://my.greenparty.ie/volunteer)

Note: show the Members link in the menu as well as the volunteer form.

-

## Member dashboard

[Dashboard](https://anon.my.greenparty.ie/dashboard)

- Overview of membership
- Communication preferences via GDPR extension

-

## Local party access

- Party organisations and officers mapped in CiviCRM
- Local officials have restricted access
  - [View membership reports](***)
  - [Email local members](***)
- Based on ACLs
- Some custom code was necessary

-

## Approach

Use out-of-the box CiviCRM and popular extensions when possible

Develop custom extensions when necessary

Long term approach with continued investment

Note: explain the + and - of each approach

# Next steps
