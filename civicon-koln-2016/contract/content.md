# Behind the scenes

-

## Designed for CiviCRM 4.6

-

## An extension

Allows for independent innovation

CiviMember can stay manageable

Some improvements could go back to core

-

##  Some client stuff hardcoded

But not much, and should be all gone soon

(need to be pragmatic and mindful of client)
